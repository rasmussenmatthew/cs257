            <h2> Dogs or Cats? </h2>
            <p> The age old question, but I think the answer is 
                rather obvious! Dogs... AND Cats!!!
            </p>

        <div id="left_body"> 
            <h2> Personal Story </h2>   
            <p> I should say that my real reason for filling this assignment up with dog and cat combo
                propaganda is because it's a life-long dream of mine. </p>
            
            <p> Picture this: You go to a shelter, looking to take home an adorable pupper... You
                walk up and down the rows of cages, past the adorable stares and occascional choars 
                of barks until you find the one. Storybook connection, maybe love at first sight is 
                more appropriate? 
            </p>

            <p> You are getting all set to take this new family member home when suddenly, out of the 
                corner of your eye you see a little kitty. Staring at you, and your new best friend,
                with big ole eyes (think Puss in Butts level). At that moment you realize, you need 
                them in your life too. You take them home too, two brand new friends for you and for 
                each other.
            </p>

            <p> If you are as serious about making this happen (like I am) here are some things to consider.

                <a href="https://www.insider.com/everything-to-know-about-getting-a-cat-and-dog-2019-8"> here</a> is a list of things to keep in mind/prepare for.

            <p> LOOK AT THESE ADORABLE FRICKEN PICTURES?!?!? HOW CAN THIS NOT BE THE BEST THING EVER?!?!?</p>

            <p> Not only do you get to experience the best of both worlds but all animals involved will have a life long friend!</p>
            <p> If you still aren't convinced after this... it might be too late... your heart has been turned to stone...</p>
