    python3 books.py --usage
    python3 books.py --help

Description:
    --authors, -a   prints a list of every author who contains given search string and prints a list of each author's books
    --titles, -t    prints a list of every book whose title contains given string
    --years, -y     prints a list of every book published between input year A and B, inclusive
    --usage, -u     prints the entire usage statement

Note:
    For any use of the --authors (-a) or --titles (-t) flags followed by an input with a space must be enclosed in quotes. 
    
    Multiple flags can be used at the same time, but their functionality will not stack. This meaning, you will not get a narrower search by using multiple flags, but rather two seperate results.
