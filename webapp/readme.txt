AUTHORS: Matthew Rasmussen/ Nacho Rodriguez-Cortes

DATA: Tables containing numerical and textual data pertaining to 
      spells and equipment within dungeons and dragons.

STATUS: We have buttons that create and then consecutively hide/reveal
      tables of spells. The tables have the ability to be filtered by 
      column and searched. The names of the spells in the tables are
      clickable but take you to a page with straight JSON data. We 
      have a home button that takes you back to the home page. 
      
NOTES: Oh man, we bit off a lot more than we can chew, or at least
      could after Matthew went down. We had to abandon plans for the
      visualiser, the entire equipment databases, and well designed 
      pages for the specific spell information. 

      Part of the reason we abandoned the equipment was our data was
      a lot messier than we initially thought, leading to probably
      too much time invested trying to clean it up. 

      From Matthew - 
            Hey Jeff, I just wanted to put a note here and praise Nacho
            for being a wonderful, patient, and hardworking partner. AS 
            you know I went down pretty much half-way through this project
            and was running at barely 50% for the rest of the term. Despite
            this Nacho dragged us along through this project to even get to
            where it is now. I don't know if you give out brownie points
            but Nacho definitely deserves them. 

            Also, generally bummed that this is how this term ended. This 
            project genuinely looked exciting and useful and I have a 
            feeling I might take another crack at this once I'm recovered
            and have the time/mental capacity.
